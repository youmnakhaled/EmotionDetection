# Image processing & Computer Vision Project 

This is a university group project where image processing techniques were implemented in tasks like face detection and facial landmarks detection to detect the emotion of a person using machine learning models. 


The project included:
1. Data cleaning
2. preprocessing
3. Face Detection - implemented the viola and jones algorithm
4. Landmark Detection
5. Feature Extraction and Selection ( used Eigen faces,Gabour Filters and PCA)
6. Model Training 
7. Testing on both test set and webcam (Real Time).

The model has been trained on MUG dataset with mutliple models on 6 moods( Anger, Disgust , Fear , Happiness , Neutral and sadness) which gave an accuracy of 88%.
